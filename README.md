### What is this?

This single page React app is intended to be embedded into a WordPress page to replace page reload and improve navigations for each volunteer job link. Instead of opening new links/windows, users can check out each job by switching between menu routes from the SAME page. This app fetches job descriptions at intial load and stores this data for easy access as the user switches menu routes without a full page reload.


### Plugins/Technology Used:
- WordPress
- React.js with Material UI and react-router
- ACF 
- ACF to Rest API
