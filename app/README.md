***update 1/3/21***
### This version of the React App supports custom post type instead of setting up parent-child relationship for pages. Creating a custom post type and storing new job postings is better data management and puts this in a centralize store location for easier access than creating a new page each time which would be quite messy if theres many job posting over time



### What is this?

This single page React app fetches job descriptions at intially load and stores this data for easy access
as the user switches menu routes without a full page reload.
